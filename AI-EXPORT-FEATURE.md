# AI-Enhanced PDF Export Feature

## Overview

The AI-Enhanced PDF Export feature integrates OpenAI's GPT-5 models server-side to generate professional engineering analysis and recommendations while preserving the integrity of all calculation data.

## Key Features

### ðŸ”’ Data Integrity Protection
- **No Data Alteration**: AI never modifies or recalculates numerical values
- **Server-Side Processing**: All AI calls and data processing happen securely on the server
- **Validation Checks**: Built-in verification ensures data consistency
- **Sanitization**: AI responses are filtered to remove any calculation attempts

### ðŸ§  AI Analysis Capabilities
- **Executive Summary**: Professional project overview and key findings
- **Technical Analysis**: In-depth engineering evaluation of design parameters
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Framework-specific compliance assessment
- **Engineering Recommendations**: Professional optimization suggestions

### ðŸ“‹ Regulatory Context Awareness
- **US EPA**: Air pollution control regulations and standards
- **EU IED**: Industrial Emissions Directive compliance
- **Engineering Codes**: ASME, NFPA, and relevant safety standards
- **Framework-Specific**: Adapts analysis to selected regulatory framework

## File Structure

```
app/api/ai-export/
â””â”€â”€ route.ts                  (157 lines) - Server-side AI integration API

lib/ai/
â”œâ”€â”€ engineering-prompts.ts    (196 lines) - Engineering-specific prompts
â”œâ”€â”€ data-validator.ts         (174 lines) - Data integrity validation
â””â”€â”€ openai-config.ts          (46 lines) - OpenAI client configuration

components/
â””â”€â”€ AIExportButton.tsx        (160 lines) - React component for AI export
```

## Usage

1. **Server Configuration**: OpenAI API key must be set in `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
2. **Select Model**: Choose from available GPT models (GPT-5 recommended)  
3. **Customize Report**: Add company, project, and engineer information
4. **Generate**: AI analysis is generated server-side and integrated into PDF report

## Data Safety Features

### Server-Side Security
- All OpenAI API calls happen on the server
- API keys never exposed to frontend
- System prompts and sensitive logic secured server-side
- Input data validated before processing

### AI Response Validation
- Removes any mathematical expressions from AI output
- Server-side data integrity checks
- Regulatory compliance validation
- Error handling with graceful fallbacks

### Regulatory Compliance
- Ensures AI recommendations align with selected framework
- Provides framework-specific guidance and standards
- Includes relevant codes and testing requirements

## Model Selection

- **GPT-5**: Latest model with superior engineering analysis capabilities (Default)
  - Uses `max_completion_tokens` parameter (8000 tokens)
  - Enhanced reasoning and technical analysis
  - Temperature fixed at 1.0 (no custom temperature support)
  - No support for presence_penalty/frequency_penalty parameters
- **GPT-5 Mini**: Faster processing with cost optimization for routine reports
- **GPT-5 Nano**: Lightweight option for quick analysis and summaries
- **GPT-4**: Previous generation model for compatibility
  - Uses `max_tokens` parameter for backward compatibility
- **GPT-4 Turbo**: Previous generation with faster processing

## Error Handling

- Graceful fallback if AI service is unavailable
- Clear error messages for API configuration issues
- Server-side validation prevents invalid data processing
- Option to export standard PDF without AI analysis

## Example Output Sections

1. **Executive Summary**: Project scope, key results, compliance status
2. **Technical Analysis**: Mass transfer performance, hydraulic adequacy
3. **Compliance Review**: Regulatory requirements and assessment
4. **Recommendations**: Design optimization and operational guidance

## Security Considerations

- **API Key Security**: Keys are stored server-side only, never exposed to client
- **Server-Side Processing**: All AI calls and sensitive operations happen on server
- **No Data Retention**: No calculation data or API responses are logged or stored
- **Secure Communication**: Standard HTTPS encryption for all communication
- **Input Validation**: Server validates all data before processing

## Server Configuration

### Environment Variables Required

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
```

### API Endpoint

- **POST** `/api/ai-export`
- **Content-Type**: `application/json`
- **Response**: PDF file download

## Dependencies

- `openai`: Official OpenAI SDK for server-side API integration
- Existing PDF export infrastructure
- Server-side validation and sanitization

## Integration

The AI export button appears next to the standard PDF export when calculation results are available and error-free. The feature is designed to complement, not replace, the existing export functionality. All AI processing is completely transparent to the user and happens securely on the server.
